There are a few potential reasons why syncing files to devices may be taking too long in your Flutter app. Here are some things you can try to speed up the syncing process:

Optimize your file sizes: Make sure your files are compressed to reduce their size as much as possible without losing quality. This can make a big difference in transfer speed.

Use asynchronous programming: When syncing files, it's important to use asynchronous programming techniques so that the UI doesn't freeze while waiting for files to transfer. Use async/await and Futures in your code to make sure the syncing process doesn't block the UI thread.

Check network connectivity: Slow syncing can sometimes be caused by poor network connectivity. Make sure your device has a strong and stable internet connection when syncing files.

Use a faster transfer method: Depending on the size and number of files you're syncing, it may be faster to use a different transfer method than the one you're currently using. For example, if you're using HTTP requests to transfer files, consider using WebSockets or other more efficient transfer methods.

Optimize your code: Finally, make sure your code is optimized for performance. Use profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks and optimize your code accordingly.

By trying these techniques, you should be able to speed up the syncing process in your Flutter app.
